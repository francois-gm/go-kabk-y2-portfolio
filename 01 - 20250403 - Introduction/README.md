# Introduction

## The “*obligation*” to self-design (15min)

Thinking about one's self-representation online.

1) **What do I want to achieve** or want out of this? Exposure? Reputation? Work? Income? Legitimacy? Collaboration?
2) **Who and where is my audience**, and how can I 'reach out' to them (in terms of location, social skills, tone).
3) How shall I 'present my self', **language-wise**, narrative-wise (the *[obligation to self-design](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/00/68457/the-obligation-to-self-design/)*)?
4) **What formats** can be used to present my self and practice, on which mediums, and on which platforms? (See 1 for hints).

### Representational possibilities

- A *website*
  
  - ... made with a website builder ([webflow](https://webflow.com), [cargo](https://cargo.site), [hotglue](https://hotglue.me), etc) (€–€€).
  - ... made *by hand* using HTML, CSS, and (a bit) of Javascript (?) (€).
  - ... made by someone you commissionned (€€€).

- A *document*
  
  - ... in the form of an ebook with interactions and hyperlinks.
  - ... or a conventionally (but timelessly) designed .pdf
  - ... hosted online via Dropbox, Google Docs, WeTransfer, etc.
  - ... or a Google Docs / spreadsheet / Github repository?
  - ... to be sent online by email, to be self-hsoted, to be shared on social medias?
 
- An *online platform presence*
  
  - ... a social media account (instagram, or what's the flavour of the day?)
  - ... a newsletter (don't forget about user's consent to subscribe to your newsletter)
    
- Being *physical*
  
  - ... attending cultural events where *peers* are present (be mindful of others – and put your ego aside)
  - ... attending fairs?
  - ... *organizing* events?
  - ... distributing promotional prints (business cards, etc)?

- Or a bit of all that...

## Online, a portfolio website

For this workshop, we will think about your online presence in the form of a (traditional) hand-coded website.

### Looking at portfolio websites, some examples (15min)

### Looking at portfolio websites, your examples (1h, 3min x 20 students)

Think about the questions earlier. Try to answer the following:

1) What they want to **achieve**?
2) Who is their **audience**?
3) **How they reach** out to their audience (which type of language they use, playful, minimal, serious, academic, etc)
4) What do **you like** about it, and why?
5) What do **you don't like** about it, and why?
6) **Does it work**, can you do/find what you were looking for (if the case)?

## Preparing your content (30min)

**Organizing**

1) **Create a folder** for your (web) project's content.
2) Inside that folder, you can create a folder for **each project** and name them by their **project name**.
3) Inside each project folder, you can create a **sub-folder** named `files`, in this folder you **add your images, downloadable documents (like pdfs), videos, etc**.
4) Within that project folder, create a `content.txt` (text) file. Inside that text file, add a **title** and a **project description**. You can also add additional (textual) information.

**Naming convention**

- **Avoid** the use of special characters in your file names.
- **Avoid** the use of capitalized charaters, as well as spaces. Separate words in your file name by either using a underscore (`my_file.jpg`) or dash (`my-file.jpg`).
- Try to be **descritive** but **concise** in the naming of your files. As an example name your image files by their project names, and what makes them specific (close-up, background view, etc). You can include the date the images were taken as well in the file names. Or the photo credit (who took the picture) in the file name.

### Preparing media for online use

**Image**

  - **Use `.jpg` for images**, avoid .png (only if transparency) and .gif (only if animated).
  - Try to target **200kb** per image.
  - Consider using `.svg` files (yes!) instead of .png files.
  - **Compress your .jpg with Photoshop** using the **'Save for Web (Legacy)'** option (under File->Export), `[Shift]+[Alt]+[Cmd]+[S]`. Choose **`50`–`60`** for quality.
  - If 'Save for Web (Legacy)' is not available, use **'Export As'** (under File->Export).
  - Or **compress your images online using Squoosh**, https://squoosh.app.
  - An image width of about 2000px is reasonable for various screen sizes while keeping quality.

**Video**

- These need to be `.mp4` files.
- Compress them below **8mb / minute** (@H.264).
- You can compress them using [Cloud convert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter).

**Audio** 

- These need to be `.mp3` files.
- Compress them below **1mb / minute**.
- You can compress them using [Online audio converter](https://online-audio-converter.com).

**Embedded content**

- You can add videos you've hosted on **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or audio files from **SoundCloud**. 
- You can find a `Share` option on each of these websites to generate an embed code that can be then used on your own website.

**Documents**

- Your resume / cv as an example.
- These can be links to Google Docs
- .. or `.pdf` files (exported as *interactive* pdfs and with appropriate compression).

- Transfonter (for converting fonts to `woff2` files to use on your website) **→** [https://transfonter.org](https://transfonter.org)



### Meta data, favicon

On your webpage, you will have the possibility to add "meta" information in the html's `<head>` section. Think about a title (visible in the browser's window), information about the author, and keywords.

Also, you will be able to add a **favicon**. What is a favicon? The favicon is the small image that is on the browser's tab. This image also gets used on your mobile device, or when you bookmark a webpage.

Your favicon shoud be:
- `512px by 512px` (square ratio)
- `.png` format
- visible at very small scales (better to test directly on your website and make edits based on that)

### Debug tool refresher

Possible issues:

1) Typos (a dot missing somewhere, a letter is another letter).
2) HTML Tags not properly opened/closed, CSS declaration not properly opened/closed.
3) You are targetting the wrong selector/class (CSS).
4) You are not on the right file!

How to use your browser's *Developer tools*:

On Google Chrome -> [Shift]+[Cmd]+[C], or `View -> Developer Tools` | Firefox -> [Alt]+[Cmd]+[I], or `Tools -> Browser tools -> Web development tools`.
