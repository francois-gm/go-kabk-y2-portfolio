# Introduction

## The “*obligation*” to self-design (15min)

Thinking about one's self-representation online.

1) What do I want to achieve or want out of this? Exposure? Reputation? Work? Income? Legitimacy? Collaboration?
2) Who and where is my audience, and how can I 'reach out' to them (in terms of location, social skills, tone).
3) How shall I 'present my self', language-wise, working out the narrative (the '[obligation to self-design](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/00/68457/the-obligation-to-self-design/)')?
4) What formats can be used to present my self and practice, on which mediums, and on which platforms? (See 1 for hints).

### Options:

- A *website*
  
  - ... made with a website builder ([webflow](https://webflow.com), [cargo](https://cargo.site), [hotglue](https://hotglue.me), etc) (€–€€).
  - ... made *by hand* using HTML, CSS, and (a bit) of Javascript (?) (€).
  - ... made by someone you commissionned (€€€).

- A *document*
  
  - ... in the form of an ebook with interactions and hyperlinks.
  - ... or a conventionally (but timelessly) designed .pdf
  - ... hosted online via Dropbox, Google Docs, WeTransfer, etc.
  - ... or a Google Docs / spreadsheet / Github repository?
  - ... to be sent online by email, to be self-hsoted, to be shared on social medias?
 
- An *online platform presence*
  
  - ... a social media account (instagram, or what's the flavour of the day?)
  - ... a newsletter (don't forget about user's consent to subscribe to your newsletter)
    
- Being *physical*
  
  - ... attending cultural events where *peers* are present (be mindful of others – and put your ego aside)
  - ... attending fairs?
  - ... *organizing* events?
  - ... distributing promotional prints (business cards, etc)?

- Or a bit of all that...
 
## Online, a portfolio website

For this workshop, we will think about your online presence in the form of a (traditional) hand-coded website.

### Looking at portfolio websites, some examples (15min)

### Looking at portfolio websites, your examples (1h, 3min x 20 students)

Think about the questions earlier. Try to answer the following:

1) What they want to achieve?
2) Who is their audience?
3) How they reach out to their audience (which type of language they use, playful, minimal, serious, academic, etc)
4) What do you like about it, and why?
5) What do you don't like about it, and why?
6) Does it work, can you do/find what you were looking for (if the case)?

## Preparing your content (30min)

**Organizing**

1) Create a folder for your (web) project's content.
2) Inside that folder, you can create a folder for each project and name them by their project name.
3) Inside each project folder, you can create a sub-folder named `files`, in this folder you add your images, downloadable documents (like pdfs), videos, etc.
4) Within that project folder, create a `content.txt` (text) file. Inside that text file, add a title and a project description. You can also add additional (textual) information.

**Naming convention**

- **Avoid** the use of special characters in your file names.
- **Avoid** the use of capitalized charaters, as well as spaces. Separate words in your file name by either using a underscore (`my_file.jpg`) or dash (`my-file.jpg`).
- Try to be **descritive** but **concise** in the naming of your files. As an example name your image files by their project names, and what makes them specific (close-up, background view, etc). You can include the date the images were taken as well in the file names. Or the photo credit (who took the picture) in the file name.

### Preparing media for online use

**Image**

  - **Use `.jpg` for images**, avoid .png (only if transparency) and .gif (only if animated).
  - Try to target **200kb** per image.
  - Consider using `.svg` files (yes!) instead of .png files.
  - **Compress your .jpg with Photoshop** using the **'Save for Web (Legacy)'** option (under File->Export), `[Shift]+[Alt]+[Cmd]+[S]`. Choose **`50`–`60`** for quality.
  - If 'Save for Web (Legacy)' is not available, use **'Export As'** (under File->Export).
  - Or **compress your images online using Squoosh**, https://squoosh.app.
  - An image width of about 2000px is reasonable for various screen sizes while keeping quality.

**Video**

You can add video files. These need to be `.mp4` files. Compress them below **8mb / minute** (@H.264). You can compress them using [Cloud convert](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter).

**Audio** 

You can add audio files. These need to be `.mp3` files. Compress them below **1mb / minute**. You can compress them using [Online audio converter](https://online-audio-converter.com).

**Embedded content**

You can add videos you've hosted on **YouTube**, **Vimeo**, or audio files from **SoundCloud**. You can find a `Share` option on each of these websites to generate an embed code that can be then used on your own website.

**Documents**

Your resume / cv as an example, these can be links to Google Docs or `.pdf` files (exported as *interactive* pdfs and with appropriate compression).
