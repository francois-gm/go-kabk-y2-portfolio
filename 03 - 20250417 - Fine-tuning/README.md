## Getting your website online

### Domain

A domain name is a unique name specific for your website, it's what you type in your address bar. Its price varies depending on the name and the extension. Some extensions are more expensive than others.

You can register domains separately but easiest is to get it together with hosting so that your domain and web server are automatically linked and setup.

Domains differ in price based on how popular/general a name is (i.e. 'bestdeals' vs. 'louisbraddock') and the extension (i.e. '.com' is cheaper than '.io').

**Do you need a domain?**

Not necessarily.

If you don't mind a URL which isn't something like "yourname.lol" or "myname.xyz" or "studioname.com" then you can use things like GitHub Pages or Netlify to host your website and those come with their own default url, i.e. https://username.github.io or https://something.netlify.app.

Personally, I think having a unique domain name is nice but its not for free so you decide obviously.

### Hosting

Hosting is a service you buy to get server space allocated. For instance you can get 10GB space and pay a yearly fee. With this you usually get some extra services such as: email and FTP.

Before people can see your website that you put on your server you need a domain, as mentioned before it's easiest to get a domain and hosting together.

**How much space do you need?**

**5** **gigabytes** is more than enough. As explained in the using media section below you need to really take care of file size and this will reduce the costs needed for hosting.

**Do you need hosting?**

No, actually not.

If you have your own domain name – or if you haven't – hosting is optional, using GitHub Pages or Netlify you can easily host your Github repository for free!

Having your own server is great, its yours and it will always be yours as long as you keep paying but having it is maybe overkill for your portfolio website.
